# Level editor for Ultimate Tapan Kaikki (TK321)

A feature complete level editor written in Rust for Ultimate Tapan Kaikki (TK321) DOS game classic. See also the [opensourced game itself](https://github.com/suomipelit/ultimatetapankaikki).

This editor was written from scratch by Ultimate Tapan Kaikki fans because the source code of the original DOS era editor has been lost.
It's heavily inspired by the original editor but does not aim to be a carbon copy. Hopefully most of the differences can be considered as improvements.

The editor runs on both desktop (using SDL2) and web browser (compiled to WASM from Rust).
